Dive into the uncharted abyss of CAUSTICAS, a procedurally generated underwater adventure that blurs the line between science fiction and survival horror. Set in a submerged world reminiscent of the eerie beauty found in "Subnautica" and inspired by the atmospheric depth of "Bioshock," this game offers a unique blend of exploration and escapism.

In "Causticas," players navigate through a network of glass tunnels submerged deep within the ocean. These clear, luminescent pathways offer breathtaking views of the ocean floor. Your mission: navigate this labyrinthine aquatic world to find a key and a diving suit, your only means of escape into the watery wilderness.

The game environment is futuristic yet haunting, with a touch of claustrophobia as danger lurks beyond the glass. As you make your way through the tunnels, the line between safety and peril thins, offering an intense gaming experience that will challenge your nerves and strategic thinking.
